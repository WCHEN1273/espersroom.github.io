<!--This is my paragraph about music, which is the first topic of today's blog.-->
    <p>Welcome to my second post on this blog. I be listening to Weatherday while I do this. I recommend their songs Pulka and Angel from their new album, and Cut Lips and Agatka from Come In. I consider myself emo because I listen to emo, screamo, emoviolence, midwest emo, etc, but I don't wear the clothing worn by the subculture. I <em>am</em> going to Hot Topic soon, though. I also like Stomach Book. You know, the person that made Fukouna Girl? If you don't, then are you living under a rock?! Well, I like their song Animals, but I also like the songs Casket Kids, METANOIA, and Folie A Deux. I like 2 0 2 1, who is a DnB artist. I like Julie, the band. They played at Coachella this year. Crochet is a good screamo band, if you're into that stuff, like me. But I also like math rock. Elephant Gym and Chinese Football can help you get into the genre. Anyway, I might have more to talk about, which I'll put in another blog today. Bye!</p>
