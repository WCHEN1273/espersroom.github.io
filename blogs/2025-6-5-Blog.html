    <p>Ok, welcome to my first blog! I will also try to post on Wordpress. Anyway, let's DO THIS!</p>
    <p>I am not a figment of your imagination. But I do have websites. Look <a href="https://resite.link/PanDemiboy">here.</a> I also know how to code in HTML and CSS. How do you think I'm making this website?! Well, this site is VERY unfinished. HOW DID YOU FIND THIS ANYWAY?! WEll, let's talk. </p>
    <p>I will post every week. Today I will talk all about me. I have a friend that's a youtuber. They are LoriComics, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LoriComics">here.</a> I watch youtube a lot. Btw, I once tried to make a blog on write.as, but now i can make AS MANY OFFSHOOTS THAT I WANT! It just has the price of having to learn HTML. I also like watching Scott The Woz. Osu! is also SO. FUN. If you have literally any computer or phone, you can play it. I also like dark humor. I own a dog. I guess. Anyway, that's all I can think of. I'll post when I can. Bye!</p>
